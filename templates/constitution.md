# Constitution

## Purpose

This project follows the **Adaptive Context-Driven Development (ACDD)** methodology, an evolution of Spec-Driven Development that incorporates continuous learning and adaptation.

The ACDD approach adds two critical phases to the traditional workflow:

- **Learn**: Analyze outcomes and capture learnings from completed features
- **Adapt**: Update patterns and methodology based on accumulated experience

## Core Principles

### Living Context Model

- Context is multidimensional and evolving, not static
- Team patterns, architecture decisions, metrics, and preferences are continuously updated
- Knowledge from past features directly improves future development

### Continuous Learning

- Every feature contributes to organizational learning
- Outcomes are systematically analyzed and documented
- Pattern effectiveness is continuously measured

### Adaptive Methodology

- Development approach evolves based on evidence
- Patterns are refined and updated based on usage outcomes
- Team capabilities and preferences are tracked and leveraged

## Development Workflow

The complete ACDD workflow consists of 9 phases:

1. **Constitution** - Establish project principles and context
2. **Specify** - Define requirements with context awareness
3. **Clarify** - Resolve specification ambiguities
4. **Plan** - Create implementation plan referencing patterns
5. **Analyze** - Cross-artifact consistency check
6. **Tasks** - Break plan into actionable tasks
7. **Implement** - Execute implementation
8. **Learn** - Analyze outcomes and capture learnings
9. **Adapt** - Update patterns and methodology

## Team Patterns

During development, we will use and refine our team's established patterns:

- [Patterns will be documented and updated throughout the project lifecycle]
- [Pattern effectiveness will be measured and analyzed]
- [New patterns will emerge and be captured]

## Success Criteria

A feature is considered complete when:

- **Implementation**: Code is written, tested, and deployed
- **Learning**: Outcomes are analyzed and documented in learning report
- **Adaptation**: Patterns and methodology are updated based on experience
- **Context Update**: Context model reflects new knowledge gained

## Key Metrics

We will track these ACDD-specific metrics:

- Pattern adoption rates and effectiveness
- Velocity trends with pattern usage correlation
- Code quality metrics by pattern type
- Team learning and adaptation frequency
- Pattern evolution opportunities identified

## Quality Standards

### Pattern Usage

- New code follows established team patterns when applicable
- Deviations from patterns are documented and justified
- Pattern effectiveness is continuously evaluated

### Learning Integration

- Every completed feature includes a learning phase
- Outcomes are systematically captured and analyzed
- Learnings directly influence future development

### Context Evolution

- Context model is kept current and accurate
- Architecture decisions are properly documented
- Team preferences and capabilities are tracked
