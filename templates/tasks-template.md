## Implementation Guidelines

### Pattern Application

- Always apply patterns as documented in team library
- Document any deviations from standard patterns
- Note pattern effectiveness observations
- Flag potential pattern improvements

### Code Quality

- Follow team coding standards
- Apply relevant patterns consistently
- Include appropriate error handling
- Write clear, maintainable code
- Add appropriate logging and monitoring

### Learning Preparation

- Track actual time vs. estimates
- Note any unexpected challenges
- Document pattern effectiveness observations
- Capture any new patterns discovered

## Metrics to Track

### Individual Task Metrics

- Task completion time
- Deviations from plan
- Code quality measures
- Test coverage achieved

### Pattern Metrics

- Pattern adherence rate
- Pattern effectiveness observations
- Deviation frequency by pattern
- Time savings vs. standard approach

## Success Criteria

### Task Completion

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met for each task
- [ ] All patterns validated and applied correctly
- [ ] Tests passing and coverage targets met
- [ ] Code review completed successfully

### Pattern Success

- [ ] All relevant patterns applied as planned
- [ ] Deviations documented and justified
- [ ] Pattern effectiveness noted
- [ ] New pattern opportunities identified

### Learning Readiness

- [ ] Implementation metrics collected
- [ ] Pattern observations documented
- [ ] Evidence for learning phase prepared
- [ ] Next steps for adaptation identified

## Review Checklist

Before marking tasks complete:

- [ ] Pattern compliance verified
