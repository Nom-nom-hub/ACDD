# Project Constitution

**Project**: ACDD Template Project
**Date**: $(date -u)
**Status**: Draft

## Purpose

This project follows the **Adaptive Context-Driven Development (ACDD)** methodology, an evolution of Spec-Driven Development that incorporates continuous learning and adaptation.

## Core Principles

### Living Context Model

- Context is multidimensional and evolving, not static
- Team patterns, architecture decisions, metrics, and preferences are continuously updated
- Knowledge from past features directly improves future development

### Continuous Learning

- Every feature contributes to organizational learning
- Outcomes are systematically analyzed and documented
- Pattern effectiveness is continuously measured

### Adaptive Methodology

- Development approach evolves based on evidence
- Patterns are refined and updated based on usage outcomes
- Team capabilities and preferences are tracked and leveraged

## Development Workflow

The complete ACDD workflow consists of 9 phases:

1. **Constitution** - Establish project principles and context
2. **Specify** - Define requirements with context awareness
3. **Clarify** - Resolve specification ambiguities
4. **Plan** - Create implementation plan referencing patterns
5. **Analyze** - Cross-artifact consistency check
6. **Tasks** - Break plan into actionable tasks
7. **Implement** - Execute implementation
8. **Learn** - Analyze outcomes and capture learnings
9. **Adapt** - Update patterns and methodology

## Quality Standards

- All features must follow the ACDD workflow
- Pattern compliance must be verified during implementation
- Learning outcomes must be documented after each feature
- Patterns must be updated based on evidence from implementations

## Team Practices

- Regular retrospectives to identify process improvements
- Pattern library maintenance as ongoing responsibility
- Continuous refinement of context model
- Evidence-based decision making
