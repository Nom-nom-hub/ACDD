# Quick Start

Get started with ACDD in just a few commands.

## 1. Install ACDD CLI

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/Nom-nom-hub/acdd-kit.git acdd init my-project --ai claude
```

This will:

- Download the latest ACDD templates
- Set up your project with AI assistant integration
- Create the necessary directory structure
- Initialize a git repository

## 2. Define Your Project Constitution

```bash
/acdd.constitution Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements
```

## 3. Specify Your First Feature

```bash
/acdd.specify Build an application that can help me organize my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by date and can be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page.
```

## 4. Plan the Implementation

```bash
/acdd.plan The application uses modern web technologies with a focus on performance and user experience. Use appropriate frameworks and libraries to implement the photo organization features.
```

## 5. Generate Tasks

```bash
/acdd.tasks
```

## 6. Implement

```bash
/acdd.implement
```

## 7. Learn and Adapt

After implementation, use the unique ACDD phases to improve your methodology:

```bash
/acdd.learn Analyze the outcomes of this feature and capture learning insights
/acdd.adapt Update patterns and methodology based on what was learned
```

This completes one full cycle of ACDD, improving your development process for the next feature.
