# Adaptive Context-Driven Development (ACDD)

ACDD (Adaptive Context-Driven Development) is an evolution of specification-driven development that incorporates continuous learning and adaptation into the development process.

## Core Principles

- **Living Context Model**: Context is multidimensional and evolving, not static
- **Continuous Learning**: Every feature contributes to organizational learning
- **Adaptive Methodology**: Development approach evolves based on evidence

## The 9-Phase Workflow

1. **Constitution** - Establish project principles and context
2. **Specify** - Define requirements with context awareness
3. **Clarify** - Resolve specification ambiguities
4. **Plan** - Create implementation plan referencing patterns
5. **Analyze** - Cross-artifact consistency check
6. **Tasks** - Break plan into actionable tasks
7. **Implement** - Execute implementation
8. **Learn** - Analyze outcomes and capture learnings
9. **Adapt** - Update patterns and methodology

The unique **Learn** and **Adapt** phases create a feedback loop that continuously improves the development methodology based on real-world implementation experience.
